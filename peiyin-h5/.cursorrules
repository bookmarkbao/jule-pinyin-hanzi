# Cursor Rules (Repo-wide)
#
# Goal: Keep changes minimal, consistent, and buildable in this Vue3 + TS + TSX + Vite + Vant4 H5 project.
#
# Must-follow:
# - Indentation: 2 spaces.
# - Prefer single quotes in TS/TSX (keep existing style; avoid unrelated reformat).
# - Use `@` alias for imports from `src/`.
# - Vue SFC uses `<script setup lang="ts">`.
# - TSX components in `src/components/` and prefer explicit types for props/emits.
# - Do NOT edit `dist/` or `node_modules/`.
# - If `auto-imports.d.ts` changes, commit it.
# - Avoid adding new dependencies; if needed, ask first.
# - Network access may be restricted; do not assume installs work.
#
# Vant:
# - Prefer auto-registered components in SFC templates.
# - In TSX, import Vant components explicitly when needed.
#
# Definition of done:
# - `pnpm build` passes (includes `vue-tsc`).
#
# Reference:
